Can add new properties to an object by using dot notation

const product = 
{
  name: 'socks'
  price: 1090
};
product.newProperty = true;

now
products =
{
  name: 'socks'
  price: 1090
  newProperty = true
}

can delete
delete product.newProperty

Use product1['delivery-time'] instead of product.deliver-time because the dot notation would not work

JSON.stringify(JS object)
JSON.parse(json)

JS objects store by references 

Even if use const for object, can change the properties of the object
This is because the reference to the object is constant, not the object itself

const object = {message: 'Hello', number: 1};
const message = object.message;
const {message} = object;
const {message, number} = object;
console.log(message); // Hello
console.log(number); // 1
// both are the same (called destructuring)
