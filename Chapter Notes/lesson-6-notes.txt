== convert both data being compared to the same type then checks
so 5 == '5.00' returns true
THAT'S WHY USE === (similar to how Java does it)
Same for != (use !==)

Falsy values:
false
0
''
NaN
undefined
null

let var1;
var is undefined (not null)

condition && console.log('message')
is same as 
if (condition)
{
  console.log('hello')
}

const currency = condition || 'USD'
is same as below
let currency;
if (!condition)
{
  currency = 'USD
}

so use || for when want to do if not condition
and use && for when want to do if condition
